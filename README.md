Lab 1:
 a recursive function stackystr to generate and print all stacky strings of a given parametern, andalso to return their count. You start with an empty string T, 
 and then recursively keep on adding newsymbols at the end of T. Appending of+is allowed if and only if the current number of plus symbols inTis<n, whereas appending
 of - is allowed if and only if T currently contains more plus symbols than minus symbols. For each allowed appending, make a recursive call on the appended T.
 To compile: gcc -o lab1 lab1.c
